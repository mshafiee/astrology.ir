Astrology.ir has been started with the aim of helping to revive Iranian style astrology with a scientific, research and computational perspective and by using the teachings of scientists such as Abu Rihan al-Biruni.

In the first step, we try to publish astrological calculations on a daily basis, and in other steps, we provide the audience with its interpretations, which not only eliminates the need to refer to the almanacs, but also provides extensive information beyond the available resources.

In astrology, our emphasis is on the Iranian style of astronomy, but this does not mean that we have not considered other styles of this science. Therefore, in addition to sidereal calculations, we also publish calculations according to western astrology.

At Astrology, we strive to use the most up-to-date and accurate available ephemerises, so we always use the latest data from NASA's JPLS HORIZONS project for computing.
But the next steps in the calculations based on this data are by algorithms designed by ourselves.

There are many ways to communicate with us. Follow us on social media.
